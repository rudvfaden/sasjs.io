# The Deployants

![height:400](https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/the-backstory-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-dwarves-explained/intro-1591296229.jpg)

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
In the beginning, models were small and simple enough that they could run on local servers and desktops, with data scattered across shared filesystems.

As they grew in size and complexity, and became hungry for more and more data, they had to be transformed in order to run remotely in cloud environments.

As a deployant, your task is to take the artefacts handed to you by the Registrans, and teleport them quickly, safely, and securely into the SAS Platform.

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
To reach the land of deployability, there are three levels to unlock.  First the environments, then the configuration, and finally the content.

# Environment

* On-Prem
* Cloud

![bg right:60% vertical height:500](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6088d89032f8673c3473567a91157080840a7bb8/413_955_2808_1685/master/2808.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=412cc526a799b2d3fff991129cb8f030)


<!-- TRANSCRIPT

The environments represent a range of mountains, one of which is much bigger than the rest.  A "Prod"igal mountain if you will.

To hasten this process, the SAS Administration Resource Kit (ARK) is available on github, which provides a number of helpful tools and utilities to help SAS customers prepare for a ViyaÂ® deployment.

Once the prep work is complete, SAS Viya can be provisioned in just a few minutes.

This is also the first point at which telekenisis can take place.  We don't actually have to deploy these mountains.  By taking up a subscription with a Viya platform provider, you can transport directly to the cloud at the top.

# Configuration

- sas-admin - Native CLI
- [PyViyaTools](https://github.com/sassoftware/pyviyatools) - Python
- [SASjs](https://cli.sasjs.io) - Node JS

<!-- TRANSCRIPT

Once the mountains are set up, we need to shape them, to barrier off the dangerous parts, and create safe trails to the upper slopes of analytics visibility.

With our power of telekenisis, we don't actually need to move around the mountain to do this.  We can make all changes in Viya entirely "on command".  Such command line interfaces include:

(list above)

# Content Artefacts

* Jobs
* VA Reports
* Model Code
* Data Driven Content
* Images
* DDL Files
* Authorization Rules
* Compute Contexts
* Configuration Settings
* CSS
* JS
* LUA

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
Now we are ready to breath some fire into our mountain, to shape it and break forth with analytical artefacts of all shapes and sizes.

These artefacts will arrive from distant lands, and the suppliers will not understand the true shape of the mountain, nor the location of the fiery crevices.  The deployist cares less about what is deployed, but more about HOW it is deployed.

with the right automations in place, the artefacts can be skylifted into their respective positions with automated GIT workflows in such a way that they can be easily restored or removed in the case of storms or dark winters.

# Benefits of Automated Deployment

- Stable Operating Environment
- Faster Feature Delivery
- Happier, More Productive Teams

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
Benefits of autoamted deployment include a more stable environment, especially when deploying frequently as smaller changes are easier to roll back.

Regular deployments also enable faster feature delivery, which
delights the heavens above, and the development teams also - because they get
to spend more time building cool stuff.

# Deployment Tips

- Know Thy Tools (Automation)
- Know Thy History (Version Control
- Know Thy Future (?)

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
Some parting words of wisdom would be this.

1) Know Thy Tools.  As the volume and variety of models and artefacts increases, so does the need to simplify and streamline the deployment process.  The tools referred to earlier are regularly update with new features and capabilities, so be sure to check them out.

2) Know Thy History.  Don't leave base camp without source control!  This provides a light should you ever need to find your way back.

3) Finally as a deployist, know thy future.  Your goal is relax at the top of the mountain, watching everything fall neatly into place thanks to all the trails and checkpoints you have implemented.
