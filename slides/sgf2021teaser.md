<!-- TRANSCRIPT
Join this session and learn how to scaffold a SASjs project, add a job, add a macro dependency, add a program dependency, add job init and term files, deploy the jobs to SAS, and run them as part of a flow.  I'll share the secret of how to deploy to Viya without a client and secret, and the entire demo will be performed from a local text editor (VSCode).
