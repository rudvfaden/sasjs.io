# SAS AF

- SECURITY
  - Especially password management
- SCALABILITY
  - Updates deployed to each machine
- SUPPORT
  - Access to appropriately skilled resource

---

# Traditional Approach

- Write SAS code to generate JS/HTML
  - ❌ (Very) high cost of maintenance
- Tied to a specific "flavour" of SAS
  - ❌ Difficult to migrate
- Coding Style inherited from original developer
  - ❌ On-boarding costs

---

# SASjs Approach

- Clean separation of Frontend from Backend
  - ✅ SAS manages data requests only
- Platform Agnostic
  - ✅ Can be deployed seamlessly to Viya, SAS 9 or Foundation SAS
- Framework-Centric
  - ✅ Industry-standard approach to project setup
