<!-- TRANSCRIPT
There are many ways to structure a SAS Project, and just as many ways to deploy it.

With all this flexibility there is a cost, and that cost is - complexity.

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
In this session we explore SASjs â€“ an open source and opinionated framework providing the power and control of local SAS development, whilst retaining the governance and scalability of remote project execution.
It can be applied to Viya Jobs, SAS 9 Stored Processes, and for the hardcore Base programmers - even regular .SAS files and catalog entries.

- [@sasjs/adapter](https://github.com/sasjs/adapter) - SAS Server Connectivity
- [@sasjs/cli](https://github.com/sasjs/cli) - CI/CD and Automated Deployment
