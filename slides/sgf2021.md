# Scaffolding SAS Projects with NPM and SASjs
## Allan Bowe

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
In the 90s and Naughties it was common for all SAS code to be executed locally using Base SAS.  In some sectors this is still the norm. For most big companies though, since the advent of enterprise BI in SAS 9, and onwards into cloud & viya, SAS tends to be written and executed on a remote server. -->

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
So how do you manage a complex codebase when it is scattered across metadata, microservices, or remote directories?
-->

---
<!-- TRANSCRIPT
And how might you scaffold your SAS project so it fits neatly into GIT, self documents, and can be quickly understood by new-hire developers?

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
In this session we will explore SASjs â€“ an open source and opinionated framework that provides the power and control of local SAS development, whilst retaining the governance and scalability of remote project execution.
-->

---
<!-- TRANSCRIPT
The framework can be applied to Viya Jobs, SAS 9 Stored Processes, and for the hardcore Base programmers out there - even regular .SAS files and catalog entries.

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
We'll also look at some freebies such as the documentation generator, data linaege mapping, and Data Controller.

# Using SASjs from NPM

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
The SASjs Framework, available from npmjs.com, enables code consistency across teams and projects, de-risks the use of shared tools and dependencies, and facilitates continuous deployment to SAS environments.

# Jobs, STPs, Programs

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
The framework can be applied to Viya Jobs, SAS 9 Stored Processes, and even regular SAS programs on a file system.

# Scaffolding a SASjs Project

<!-- TRANSCRIPT
Join this session and learn how to scaffold a SASjs project, add a job, add a macro dependency, add a program dependency, add job init and term files, deploy the jobs to SAS, and run them as part of a flow.  I'll share the secret of how to deploy to Viya without a client and secret, and the entire demo will be performed from a local text editor (VSCode).
