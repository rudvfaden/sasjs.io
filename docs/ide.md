IDE - Integrated Development Environment
====================

VSCodium
---------------------

Our favourite is VSCodium - VSCode without the telemetry!  It's a great IDE and very usable for both SAS and Web development.  It also has many marketplace extensions - these are our favourites:

## Extensions

### SAS-Syntax
A syntax highligher for SAS code

### Gremlins Tracker

When using SASjs and sharing the deploy script from one environment (eg UTF8) to another (eg WLATIN1) you can end up with code that will not run in EG due to the existence of hidden special characters.

This plugin will highlight all the rows containing such 'gremlins'.  A real time saver / problem avoider!

## Server

It is now easier than ever to set up your own cloud instance of VSCodium and access it from any browser (even on ipad!).  This means you can run your builds in a powerful (or throwaway) cloud server instance without running down your battery, or being dependent on a single device.

A guide to setting up an instance on digital ocean is available [here](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/v3.8.0/doc/guide.md).
