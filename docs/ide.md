IDE - Integrated Development Environment
====================

VSCodium
---------------------

Our favourite is VSCodium - VSCode without the telemetry!  It's a great IDE and very usable for both SAS and Web development.  It also has many marketplace extensions - these are our favourites:

### SAS-Syntax
A syntax highligher for SAS code

### Gremlins Tracker

When using SASjs and sharing the deploy script from one environment (eg UTF8) to another (eg WLATIN1) you can end up with code that will not run in EG due to the existence of hidden special characters.

This plugin will highlight all the rows containing such 'gremlins'.  A real time saver / problem avoider!

### Remote Extensions

VSCode allows you as a developer to work locally and run code on a virtual machine.  This feature is not available in VSCodium however (as it is not open source).
