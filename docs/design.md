# Design

Save yourself a lot of rework by getting at least a rough idea of what you want to build, before you build it!

The design process is split between UX (User Experience, the overall flow) and UI (the User Interface, the actual look and feel).

Useful tools:

* [lucidchart.com](lucidchart.com) - great for diagrams
* Sketch (mac only)
* [figma.com](https://www.figma.com) - browser based design tool
