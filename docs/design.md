Design
====================

Save yourself a lot of rework by getting at least a rough idea of what you want to build, before you build it!


The frontend design process is split between UX (User Experience, the overall flow) and UI (the User Interface, the actual look and feel).

Useful tools:

* [mockplus](https://www.mockplus.com/)
* [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - wireframes
* [lucidchart.com](https://lucidchart.com) - great for diagrams
* [figma.com](https://www.figma.com) - browser based design tool

## Frameworks
It's possible to build good looking apps quickly without having to specify every detail if you can follow existing style guides / frameworks.  Choices include:

* [Semantic ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) - with a specific [version](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) for React
* [Clarity Design](https://clarity.design) - Angular but will soon support React / Vue also
* [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) - built by Google
* [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web) - built by Microsoft
