Releasing
====================

If you have followed the conventional-commit standard you can now generate a version number according to sementic-versioning along with relevant release notes.

There are two great command-line tools for managing a release:

1) `standard-version` - will generate a CHANGELOG and the version number but won't push the release

2) `semantic-release` - will manage everything including the release.  A great guide is available [here](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/getting-started.md#getting-started)
