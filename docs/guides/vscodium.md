VSCodium
====================

VSCodium is VSCode without the telemetry!  It's a great IDE and very usable for both SAS and Web development.  It also has many marketplace extensions - these are our favourites:

## Gremlins Tracker

When using SASjs and sharing the deploy script from one environment (eg UTF8) to another (eg WLATIN1) you can end up with code that will not run in EG due to the existence of hidden special characters.

This plugin will highlight all the rows containing such 'gremlins'.  A real time saver / problem avoider!
