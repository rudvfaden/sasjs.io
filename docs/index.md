Building Web Applications using SASÂ®
====================

Whilst SAS gives you the Power to Know, HTML5 gives you the Power to Show!  It's a powerful combination for automating workflows, surfacing analytics, and building breathtaking user experiences.

It's fast, it's easy, and it's fun!

You can build an app on SAS9 in just 2 lines of code:

```sas
filename playme url "https://sasjs.io/game";
%inc playme;
```

Below is a demo of building and deploying a React App on SAS Viya, with two services in just 5 minutes:

What is SAS JS?
---------------------
SAS JS is a framework - a collection of independent tools which, taken together, provide a serious accelerator to SAS web development projects.

It consists of three parts:

1. Macro library ([macrocore](https://github.com/sasjs/core)).  A collection of macro based tools for SAS web application development.  See [documentation](https://core.sasjs.io).

2. CLI tool ([sasjs-cli](https://github.com/sasjs/cli)).  An NPM command line utility for automating the compilation, build and deployment of your SAS-Powered HTML5 Application.

3. Data Adapter ([sasjs](https://github.com/sasjs/adapter)). A JavaScript library to handle the communication between your HTML5 application and the SAS 9 or Viya backend.  See [documentation](https://adapter.sasjs.io)
